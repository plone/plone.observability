# Changes

<!-- towncrier release notes start -->

## 1.0.0b7 (2026-06-25)

### New features:

- Add `plone_request_duration_seconds_max{auth="authenticated|anonymous"}` — a per-scrape-window gauge of the worst-case request duration. A histogram can only bound latency to its bucket edges, so the true maximum is now tracked directly and reset on every scrape, giving operators the real max backend response time alongside the `histogram_quantile`-derived p90/p99. ([#17](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/17))


## 1.0.0b6 (2026-06-25)

### New features:

- Add `plone_zodb_conflicts_total{retry="true|false"}` — a storage-agnostic counter of ZODB ConflictErrors during request publication (including the silently-retried ones), captured via an IPubBeforeAbort subscriber. ([#26](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/26))

### Bug fixes:

- ZODB load/store metrics are now storage-agnostic: `plone_zodb_loads_total`/`plone_zodb_stores_total` counters come from a minimal, O(1) ZODB activity monitor (works on FileStorage, RelStorage, zodb-pgjsonb), replacing the FileStorage-only metrics. Installed by default unless a monitor already exists; disable with `PLONE_OBSERVABILITY_ZODB_ACTIVITY_MONITOR=0`. The content provider now steps aside silently on non-ZCatalog backends (which ship their own provider). ([#25](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/25))

### Internal:

- Adopt the shared ruff ruleset (single-line imports, B/SIM/UP/C4, py310 target), format ZCML with zpretty, run pre-commit as the single source in CI, and gate test coverage at 90%.


## 1.0.0b5 (2026-06-24)

### Bug fixes:

- Declare the `z3c.autoinclude.plugin` entry point (`target = plone`) so the package's ZCML — the `@@metrics` view, metric providers, OpenTelemetry and auth subscribers, and the `zodb` readiness check — loads automatically on a standard Plone instance instead of staying dormant after `pip install`. ([#21](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/21))


## 1.0.0b4 (2026-06-24)

### Breaking changes:

- The health server and OpenTelemetry activation now start from the WSGI pipeline filters instead of Zope process startup, so `zconsole`/script runs no longer bind the health port or patch the catalog. **Upgrade:** add the `egg:plone.observability#healthserver` filter to your pipeline, otherwise the health server no longer starts. ([#16](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/16))

### Bug fixes:

- Emit `plone_info` as a `gauge` instead of the OpenMetrics-only `info` type. The `@@metrics` endpoint advertises classic Prometheus exposition format (`text/plain; version=0.0.4`), in which `info` is invalid, so Prometheus rejected the **entire** scrape with `invalid metric type "info"`. `plone_info` now follows the conventional `*_info` gauge pattern (constant value 1, version in labels). ([#18](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/18))


## 1.0.0b3 (2026-06-22)

### New features:

- Add an `auth="authenticated"|"anonymous"` label to all request metrics, and `enduser.authenticated` (plus opt-in `enduser.id` via `PLONE_OBSERVABILITY_OTEL_USER_ID`) to the publish trace span.


## 1.0.0b2 (2026-06-22)

### Documentation:

- Document the recommended way to wire the WSGI filters (request metrics and the OpenTelemetry root request span) via cookiecutter-zope-instance 3.1.0+ `wsgi_filters`, instead of hand-editing `zope.ini`.


## 1.0.0b1 (2026-06-18)

### New features:

- Add optional `[opentelemetry]` extra: distributed tracing (root request, publishing, catalog query, and ZODB commit spans) with OTel-native configuration. Catalog tracing is backend-agnostic, covering both standard ZCatalog-based Plone and plone-pgcatalog. No-op when the extra is not installed. ([#2](https://github.com/plone/plone.observability/issues/2))
- Initial release: Kubernetes-style health probes (`/live`, `/ready`, `/startup`) on a separate daemon-thread port that survives worker exhaustion, plus a pluggable `@@metrics` endpoint with Prometheus and JSON output and ZCA-extensible health checks, metric providers, and formatters.
